A routine heart screening can check for warning signs of heart disease, any heart abnormalities or any risk factors for heart disease that could be minimized. The doctor may calculate your body mass index as well as incorporate a blood pressure screening, blood glucose test and cholesterol panel into your assessment. These indicators can show important facts about your heart’s health and allow your doctor to prescribe a plan of treatment personalized for your physique and lifestyle.</p> 
    <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Our specialist ENT doctors, also known as otolaryngologists, are among the best in their field. While the primary line of treatment is medicines and other non-invasive treatments, surgeries might be required if these methods are ineffective, depending on individual cases. Most of these surgeries are minimally invasive and are done at our hospital 
        on a day-care basis under complete observation and sanitary conditions. All after-care procedures are also taken care</p><br>
    <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Body mass index, better known as BMI, is a measure of an individual’s weight, body composition (fat versus muscle) and waist circumference. Being overweight, and especially carrying weight in the abdominal area, is a major risk factor for heart disease, heart attack and stroke; maintaining a healthy weight can lead to better heart and overall health. A BMI range of 18.5-24.9 is considered ideal and shows that one is in a normal weight range. A cardiologist can offer tips for maintaining a healthy weight and exercise plan.</p><br>
